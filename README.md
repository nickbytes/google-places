# Proteus - Gulp, *Decaf*

## About *Decaf* version
[Proteus](http://github.com/thoughtbot/proteus) is a collection of useful
starter kits to help you prototype faster made by the great people at [thoughtbot](http://thoughtbot.com). It follows the
[thoughtbot styleguide](https://github.com/thoughtbot/guides) and includes their
favorite front end tools.

But I don't typically use [Coffeescript](http://coffeescript.org). I've got nothing against it, I just don't know it well enough to be productive.

This version uses Javascript instead.
